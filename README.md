After learning SQL I wanted to test how to control it with python, 
so I combined it with something I find interesting (swing dancing)
and that's how this project happened. Before I stored info about 
songs in MS Excel file, and now I moved it to a database file. 

Sometimes I play music on swing dancing parties and sometimes 
I teach, but really I just want to have my playlist ordered
by tempo, so it's somewhat useful. The real thing for me though,
is that it is a way to not forget how to use SQL, as I will
use this program constantly, and since I can also use it 
on my phone I can add new songs while on a bus, etc.
